# DISTORTION
The python code generates distortion path between two phases of inorganic crystals

To study ferroelectricity or phase transitions in crystals, one often needs to generate a distortion path between phases of a crystal. This is where this code comes handy. For further qualitative symmetry based analysis, please visit https://iso.byu.edu/iso/isotropy.php.

This code only works for inorganic crystals. For hybrid perovskites, where rotation of molecules is important due to their order-disorder phase transition, an advanced version of the FORTRAN code credited to my advisor comes handy (See https://github.com/USFmatscilab?tab=repositories)
